I graduated college in 2012 with a BA in History and a minor in pre-law. Doe eyed and optomistic, I entered the real world with an unrealistic scope of what my life would look turn out to be.

After coming to terms with the expense and mental stress that three years of law school would incur, I conceded defeat and commenced a years long journey of unrewarding jobs. After floundering in IT sales, Chemical Operations, Energy Brokering, and construction management, I realized it was time make myself invaluable. I was tired of constantly changing cities ( I lived in five cities in five years), and came to the conclusion that learning computer programming, while incredibly difficult, might be a way for me to find my niche in the world. 

While I still grapple with maintaining discipline towards completing my program, it is my hope that upon completion of my journey with Flatiron, I will no longer need to worry about which city I might live in next, or if I will be able to find a job with my undergrad degree in History (sigh). 

Here is to hoping!
